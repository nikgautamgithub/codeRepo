# codeRepo

You can contribute source code for any language.
If the number of files in the root directory is increasing a lot, then you can rearrange them in folder structure.
These repositories are meant to help begineers.



- ### Guidelines for Contribution
    1. **Fork** the Repository
    2. **Add, edit or enhance** code.
    3. Once you are done with your contribution, **issue a PULL REQUEST**. The Maintainer may ask you for a few changes. Once everything seems good, your code will be pulled and added to the original Repository branch.
